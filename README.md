# Spaceship Titanic Prediction

This project is a solution for the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic", where the goal is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code uses several libraries which can be installed using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow tensorflow_decision_forests

## Project Structure

- `train.csv`: Training data file (not included in the repository)
- `test.csv`: Test data file (not included in the repository)
- `spaceship_titanic_prediction.py`: Main Python script containing the code
- `submission.csv`: Output file with predictions (generated by the script)

## Usage

1. Ensure that `train.csv` and `test.csv` are in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Run the script:
python spaceship_titanic_prediction.py
3. The script will generate a `submission.csv` file with predictions.

## Data Preprocessing

The `datapreprocess` function performs the following steps:
- Drops the 'Name' column
- Splits the 'Cabin' column into 'cab_deck', 'cab_num', and 'cab_side'
- Fills missing values in numerical columns with mean values
- Fills missing values in categorical columns with mode values
- Performs one-hot encoding on categorical columns

## Model

The project uses a Random Forest Classifier with the following parameters:
- Number of estimators: 100
- Random state: 42

The data is split into training and validation sets (80% train, 20% validation).

## Submission

The script generates a submission file (`submission.csv`) with two columns:
- PassengerId: The ID of the passenger (preserved from the test data)
- Transported: The prediction (True or False)

## Results

The script prints out the following metrics for the validation set:
- Accuracy Score
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

The actual performance on the test set can be evaluated by submitting the `submission.csv` file to Kaggle.
